### Homework6
## Coding assignment for ECEV 42900
Professor: **Sarah Cobey**, **Greg Dwyer** \
Student: **Kiseok Lee**  

In this assignment, you must simulate the birth-death model, to reproduce figure 2.
This code is conceptually similar to the code for the environmental-stochasticity model, in
that it also loops over realizations and time. This code is a little different, however, in that it
records the population size at a range of times, but that part of the code is written for you.
The conceptually challenging part of the code is instead understanding the algorithm. Roughly
speaking, it works like this:
